Features
========

* Written in Python.
* Similar in concept to the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE).
* Integration with the cluster's job scheduler (currently only SLURM implemented).
* Generating large amounts of input files becomes easy.
* EMTO calculations controlled by Python language:

  * Full control over everything

* The goal is to minimise time spent on things that can reliably be automated.
* High-quality EOS module for Equation Of State fitting:

  * Morse
  * Murnaghan
  * Birch-Murnaghan
  * SJEOS
  * Vinet
  * Pourier-Tarantola
  * Anton-Schmidt
  * Taylor series
  * Polynomial fit

* Built-in functions for result analysis:

  * Determine ground state lattice constants, bulk moduli, energy and elastic constants.

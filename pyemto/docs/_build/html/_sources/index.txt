Welcome to pyEMTO's documentation!
==================================

.. note::

   This is pyEMTO's html documentation. pyEMTO is a toolkit used to:

   1. **Easily generate input files and corresponding batch scripts for the EMTO (Exact Muffin-Tin Orbitals) solid-state  physics software.**
   2. **Automating routine tasks such as calculation of ground state volume and elastic constants.**
   3. **Analysing the results.**

   Development of this project started when the authors needed a fast and convenient way to generate large amounts of input files for various different types of calculations with the EMTO software. The design goal of pyEMTO is to  minimise time spent on writing input files and other "repetitive" tasks in the most convenient and reliable way possible.
